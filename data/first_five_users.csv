-Halo-,,"I am the ghostliest Puerto Rican/Roman Italian you will ever meet... I am an ENTJ on the MBTI. I'm not super fond of people unless they are intelligent and trustworthy, or AT LEAST somewhat good looking or useful in one way or another (superficial yet deep- just don't let the looks run out). What can I say? I appreciate brains and beauty; one or the other; both is ideal.  I keep a small ring of close friends, the rest are pretty much expendable; useful as pawns to an end, and I like it that way. It takes a bit of work to earn my trust and friendship, and though I am quick to make acquaintances and connections, I am just as quick to shed them if they are not productive. I like to get returns on my investments, and this includes time with people. Don't waste my time. You won't be happy with what I take in return. I can be your best friend or your worst enemy. Anything else is business as usual. 
I'm a typical NT in that I don't like to spend a lot of time in the ""here-and-now"". I have a very keen sense of reality, but am eager to change it. I tend not to be a very ideological or idealistic person so as to remain objective. I can be bit of a misanthrope, and I judge very quickly and harshly, so never ask me my thoughts unless you want an honest answer and are prepared to have your ideas dissected and handed back to you in pieces.  
You will probably come to the conclusion that I am either stupid, very mean, very smart, negative, funny or friendly as this is what I am often told. Charming right? I can be if need be. You probably would recognize me as in touch with humanity until I choose to let it fall apart- then my friend YOU would see what we are all truly made of in our hearts (insert evil laughter here).",,,Female,Type 8w7,Male,[]
