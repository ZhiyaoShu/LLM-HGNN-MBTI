-Halo-,,"I am the ghostliest Puerto Rican/Roman Italian you will ever meet... I am an ENTJ on the MBTI. I'm not super fond of people unless they are intelligent and trustworthy, or AT LEAST somewhat good looking or useful in one way or another (superficial yet deep- just don't let the looks run out). What can I say? I appreciate brains and beauty; one or the other; both is ideal.  I keep a small ring of close friends, the rest are pretty much expendable; useful as pawns to an end, and I like it that way. It takes a bit of work to earn my trust and friendship, and though I am quick to make acquaintances and connections, I am just as quick to shed them if they are not productive. I like to get returns on my investments, and this includes time with people. Don't waste my time. You won't be happy with what I take in return. I can be your best friend or your worst enemy. Anything else is business as usual. 
I'm a typical NT in that I don't like to spend a lot of time in the ""here-and-now"". I have a very keen sense of reality, but am eager to change it. I tend not to be a very ideological or idealistic person so as to remain objective. I can be bit of a misanthrope, and I judge very quickly and harshly, so never ask me my thoughts unless you want an honest answer and are prepared to have your ideas dissected and handed back to you in pieces.  
You will probably come to the conclusion that I am either stupid, very mean, very smart, negative, funny or friendly as this is what I am often told. Charming right? I can be if need be. You probably would recognize me as in touch with humanity until I choose to let it fall apart- then my friend YOU would see what we are all truly made of in our hearts (insert evil laughter here).",,,Female,Type 8w7,Male,[]

The quest for more knowledge, the meaning of life, the philosophical questions?my mind is always occupied, and what?s exciting is when I get to follow through with an insight and do something. 
I think I am a mystery to people. They never really understand me and part of me enjoys that. More often though, I long to be understood. 
I need a balance between people contact and working on creative projects and will break away from interactions when I get tired out. 
I tend to intuitively read people very quickly, but I have to be cautious not to make assumptions. 
I feel other people?s feelings, and taking on that burden can make me too intense and serious, where I can?t be spontaneous and fun loving...

Aleksandra,,"Ok, I'm not gonna try to come up with anything creative, here's some basic information about me :
My name is Aleksandra, I'm 18 years old, I live with my parents and my younger brother in a small town near Kraków, Poland. I first heard about the ennagram about 3 years ago and it was some kind of an eyes opening experience for me. I found out about MBTI a bit later ( a year ago - in my country it's less popular than enneagram ), and since then I've tried to gather as much information about it as I can. 
I'd describe myself as a sensitive girl with a tomboy side. In my room you would find a collection of porcelain dolls as well as a huge wrestling poster on the wall. At school I'm equally into maths and humanities. 
My favourite movie : Saving Private Ryan, Fight Club,
Actors : Edward Norton, Ralph Fiennes, Tom Hanks
Books : Jeffery Deaver, Charlotte Bronte
Music :  prog metal
I guess that's all.
Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.
Sorry for my English, I'm doing my best to improve it ;)",, https://www.personalitycafe.com/members/aleksandra.html,Male,Type 4,,[]

Though of course I have a ways to go before I become anything like an editor. lol I am not very sociable, a downfall of mine, I have a terrible social phobia that hinders my life.

,,"***If I've offended you*** 
I'm very sorry, I assure you it wasn't my intention :x 
I always debate on whether I should actually put something meaningful here or just put something witty; but seeing as this is a website for personality types I guess I should tell you a bit about me :) 
Well, I love personality typing. In fact it was my trying to find out more about myself that I learned about the Myers-Briggs test and found out about the types. Originally I tested as an ENFP but I later realized that I was answering based on what I *wished* I was, not how I actually felt. 
So, turns out I'm an INFJ (only slightly more so than INTJ). I feel like I fit in much better with my profile now :) 
I'm pretty much textbook INFJ, but I wouldn't say I'm as warm and nurturing as most others seem, which worries me sometimes. Im sarcastic, I like to play games of wit, and occasionally enjoy messing with people. Maybe it's because I have trouble being warm with others when I know how much they're dishonest with me, or I feel scorned by them (it's hard for me to let things go). I can be very nurturing and protective towards animals (and plants even, I view them as my little essences of pure life, because of how simple they are) but I'm also very realistic. I think its because of my thinking/feeling borderline. 
My feelings towards humanity, at first, are with pessimism and borderline disgust. Humans are so complicated, mean, selfish. Myself included. 
But just when I wish I could write humans off as something I dislike I think of the amazing people I know, who are kind, warm, and genuinely good. Then I'm forced to see humanity as simply having a great capacity for both good and evil, if you think of things in terms or good and evil, but that's a whole other topic of my philosophy ;)

I am also a gamer and am into games such as pokemon, portal, The Elders Scrolls, Fable and Okami. 
I don't watch much TV but when I do, its mostly stuff like Game of Thrones, The White Queen, Sherlock, Being Human, Doctor Who and comedies such as Miranda, The Big Bang Theory and old stuff like Red Dwarf.

""If someone wants to be part of your life, theyll be there. So dont bother saving a spot for someone who wont make an effort to stay.""  
[QUOTE]""Jealousy is simply and clearly the fear that you do not have value. Jealousy scans for evidence to prove the point - that others will be preferred and rewarded more than you. There is only one alternative - self-value. If you cannot love yourself, you will not believe that you are loved. You will always think it's a mistake or luck. Take your eyes off others and turn the scanner within. Find the seeds of your jealousy, clear the old voices and experiences. Put all the energy into building your personal and emotional security. Then you will be the one others envy, and you can remember the pain and reach out to them."" - Jennifer James[/QUOTE]

----------------- 
I cannot ""see"" myself, it is weird. I am difficult to understand, to me. I spend a lot of time looking at internal mirrors, very self-centered, but who else would I be centered in? You? 
Not feminine. I wear makeup but I also think men should wear it. I'd like to describe myself as neutral, with a vagina. 
Keep it real or don't keep it at all... Its kinda simple. I have no idea why people need to be fake/pretentious. No one is in the position to judge here. Live your own life, build your lane and stay in it. Not voicing my opinions is my current lesson, but be sure that when I choose to, you shall have it. 
Straight-forward, honest, no BS - I try my best - Dry sarcasm is to be expected however.  I appreciate the same, regardless of its consequences.  
Cold and fuzzy - product of society. 
Pet peeve: wasted time/effort. Actually I am peeved by people a lot more than I think it is nice to admit (so I am admitting it). Don't worry though, your online presence will never annoy me.

Currently live with her, my ISXP stepdad and our three cats. 
Interests include art (sometimes digital), chocolate, and BOOKS.
Especially fantasy books. But honestly as long as the book is good I'm happy.
My favourite book is The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss. Feel free to talk to me about it ^^ 
Loves history, especially anything before the industrial era. Have made an extensive effort to create a medievall world in The Sims 2 with ridiculous amounts of planning involved. Don't ask about it unless you want me to never stop talking. 
I play games occasionally, not all that often. Prefer games with a story.
Does not like zombies. They're scary. Nope. Still play Minecraft on an off despite that, not all that into it. I mostly just play it when I feel that I want to wander the world but can't because money/weather. 
Very obsessed with my cats. Love them all. Could talk about those forever. 
I knit occasionally. But I mostly just make scarves. Can't make much else, really.
Would like to get into tabletop roleplaying, but haven't found people to get into it with, so I sit alone in my room with a diceset and nothing to do. 
Hopes to get to the UK and study English Literature (and creative writing) sometime soon. 
I have a book I've written more than a 100 pages on :D It's the biggest accomplishment I think I've managed in life so far. Apart from graduating and all that, of course.

I'm just an ordinary guy from northwest England. Engaged to my girlfriend/partner of 8 years. We marry in June 2014. 
My parents identified me as an introvert (a loner they called it) when I was a small kid - at friends parties they'd find me perfectly happy upstairs playing on my own.
From an early childhood fascination outer space I knew I was a bit unusual when I asked for the ""Osbourne Big Book of Science"" for my 8th Birthday. My interest in the natural world has continued ever since, after a degree in bioscience I now work as a scientist for a large multinational corporation. I have the luxury of operating across a number of different fields, which keeps me interested and happy. 
I'm fascinated by psychology and personal development, so finding out about MBTI was inevitable for me. The other two tools I am a fan of are Action Inquiry and Schema therapy. I guess I'll get round to writing about these for everyone when I get chance.",, https://www.personalitycafe.com/members/associative.html,,Type 5w4,Male,"['reading-group', 'metamorphosis-cafe', 'intps-ftw']"

Aslynn,['kareem'],"I know what the caged bird feels, alas! 
When the sun is bright on the upland slopes; 
When the wind stirs soft through the springing grass, 
And the river flows like a stream of glass; 
When the first bird sings and the first bud opes, 
And the faint perfume from its chalice steals-- 
I know what the caged bird feels! 
I know why the caged bird beats his wing 
Till its blood is red on the cruel bars; 
For he must fly back to his perch and cling 
When he fain would be on the bough a-swing; 
And a pain still throbs in the old, old scars 
And they pulse again with a keener sting-- 
I know why he beats his wing! 
I know why the caged bird sings, ah me, 
When his wing is bruised and his bosom sore,-- 
When he beats his bars and he would be free; 
It is not a carol of joy or glee, 
But a prayer that he sends from his heart's deep core, 
But a plea, that upward to Heaven he flings-- 
I know why the caged bird sings!

Barcelonic,,"Sometimes  i look at my life like a TV show, with episodes in which I did something random and different every time. 
I liked early PC gaming, then i became a bit of a socialite and stopped playing. I've spent time living on a camp site by the beach and earning a free stay working in their cafe, I play the guitar but i love both instrumental & electronic music, i learned capoeira & breakdancing from an Indian guy in exchange for being an actor for a play he'd written at a local theatre, then i set up my own weekly event at a local nightclub and ran that for a year before moving it to a better club which some of my friends had acquired, but eventually i found myself waiting tables for a few years before joining the claims department of a car insurance company. I worked there for several years and worked up to fraud department in a position they created for me. I loved it but then i was diagnosed with ME/CFS and couldn't work anymore. Slowly but surely it went from mild to severe and loads of other health problems began to fall on top of me. 
I'm still housebound but i make it a point of principle to summon every ounce of my being to take a holiday abroad every couple of years (whenever i can afford the money and have the strength). My two ambitions in life are A) to ensure I don't die before my parents, and B) find a way to make money and move to a coastal area in a country with a tropical climate (hot & humid), like maybe Costa Rica. :)",,,,,,[]

Blazing_Glitter,,"Born in 1980.
Still going. 
Okay, stolen from another site where I had to write a bio... 
~~~
April was born in 1980, which means she has experienced big hair and tight-rolled jeans. Saturday mornings in her childhood were a time for Smurfs and Pee-Wee's Playhouse. However, she is proud to state that she's never rocked out to Poison or Bon Jovi.  
In her 3 decades on Earth, April has lived in two states and attended 18 schools. She has been committed, married and divorced. She has loved and lost, and loved again. April all but refuses to turn on a television and doesn't know how a remote control works. She has strengths and weaknesses and hates writing bios.  
Currently April can be found living in the suburbs of Detroit with her boyfriend and her old cranky cat. She lives with bipolar disorder and anxiety and tries not to let them stop her. She intends on adopting a unicorn and joining a fairy clan when the time in right.
~~~ 
Since writing that I've found a few special shows that I will turn on the television for (Doctor Who, Wilfred, Louis C.K.'s show) and have had to learn how to use the remote control, but remain oblivious as to how it works.",, https://www.personalitycafe.com/members/blazing_glitter.html,Both,Type 4,Female,[]

CaptainShawnee,"['Artemis 2x4', 'ATLeow', 'Bear987', 'catspajamas', 'Monsieur Melancholy', 'Sage del Viento']","I feel like I should fill this out a little bit better. 
Well I'm Shawnee! I am one of those people who seems to be of a mystery race, since no one really guesses it, but I can assure you I'm Native American, Swedish, Irish, and then some. I'm about 90% sure I was a pirate in a past life, but I don't want to go to a psychic to know for sure and then end up being wrong. 
I'm an INFP until someone tells me otherwise, in which I'll probably end up being an ENFP. I'm one of those fun ambiverts that can go from OMG HI YOU! :D to ""Oh hi...you? .___.;"" I'm also a professional complainer and I apologize for that. 
I live in the United States, though the state I'm in is NOT the one I would have chosen first. Actually I think it would have been just ahead of Arkansas, Mississippi (even though my best friend lives there now), Alabama, and possibly Georgia. Actually pretty much anywhere that's humid. I've been to central Florida and I didn't enjoy it. I'm a westerner with a liberal bias all day erryday. 
I'm actually a really nice person, partially because I hate conflict and partially because I legitimately like people if they're likable, and if you want to be my friend then I'm pretty sure we can arrange that. Bare (bear?) in mind that I'm a little odd though -- I have an intense CreepyPasta/horror stuff addiction and it doesn't help alleviate my ever present nightmares. And by nightmares I mean awful night terrors that are hyper-realistic. Also keep in mind that I'm really moody -- as in I have ups, downs, lefts, and rights. It makes me really hard to be around, and I try not to let it interfere with other things, but in the end I can't really control it or how exactly I act while I'm in any given mood. 
Did I scare you off yet? No? Well then... welcome to my insanity! Enjoy your stay :D",West Coast~, https://www.personalitycafe.com/members/captainshawnee.html,Male,,Female,[]

Chelsey Xan Carlson,,"I enjoy a challenge and long for the thrill of excitement and risk. I love people, viewing everyone and everything as part of an often extraordinary, interconnected whole. I see patterns and connections in everything. I am naturally inclined toward forming relationships with people and animals. Intense emotional experiences vital to a life of substance and I seek harmonious relationships with others and within myself. 
Some might say that I am a human guinea pig because I love to experiment on myself and with life. I am a risk taker and extremely bold! When I want something in life, I go for it. I am never afraid of taking the plunge, especially if there?s risk involved. I don?t shy away from speaking my mind in some way. Everything I do is carefully and critically calculated in my mind beforehand. It is almost as if, I am rehearsing a script with different endings in my head and I?ll try each one to see what works. I live life as it should be lived: with total enthusiasm and challenge what I fear most. 
I am unpredictably spontaneous, charismatic with a great deal of amusingly unconventional attributes. I do gain the favor of the more straitlaced individuals because in spite of my nonconformity, I am warm, affectionate, outgoing, fun, and genuinely like people. I enjoy telling stories, especially funny stories about my family and friends. If you want the world to know something, just tell me. Perfection is an illusion that I don?t buy into. Close enough is often all right with me, which may unnerve more precise thinking types. I become closer to perfection each day but even I know that absolute truth or absolute perfection does not exist because we are in a constant state of change for better or for worse- till death do we part. 
I make a good first impression. I am mature and playful, these two sides to my personality are constantly dueling it out. Part of me likes all of the finer things in life, while part of me is just like a big kid. No matter what side I choose, I am always adventurous and dramatic. I take life by the horns. I am up for fun of all kinds, and it?s hard for me to say no to a good time. I tend to go until I drop. I am outgoing and engaging, with both strangers and friends. I truly enjoy being with people and bring energy into any situation. Enthusiastic and fun, I am the first to say, ?let?s go?! 
My attention span can be short often being easily intrigued and distracted by new friends and acquaintances, forgetting about the older ones for long stretches at a time. Everyone doesn?t have to believe that I am wonderful and fascinating person. Humility? I don?t have much to be humble about! And I might as well promote myself, because no one else will. I believe that I am a pretty special person and I let everyone know about it. As long as it is true, I will let my colors shine. I am learning not to pretend to be confident within areas that I am insecure. That is a death trap. Be proud about being who you are, sure it?s alright to fake it till you make it, but be honest with yourself when things don?t work out. 
I am conscientiousness; generally good at balancing work and play, when I need to buckle down, I can usually get tasks done. But I?ve been known to goof off when I know I can get away with it. Overall my life is relatively smooth, I remain cool and collected, but sometimes I do panic; there are a few rides on the emotional roller coaster that I would like to eliminate. My self-interest overrules and others come later when I am not able to function with my A game. To Be True to Thy Own Self is the most important task I intend to successfully master. I want to know exactly who I am and exactly who God is. How can we have a relationship if we don?t even know each other. This is a mind blowing mystery to me. There are far too many riddles to solve and not enough clues. Each time I think I figure it out, I am quickly starting back from Go again with no $200 dollars. I want out. I want to escape this trap I am caught in.","ABILENE, TX", https://www.personalitycafe.com/members/chelsey-xan-carlson.html,,Type 4,Female,[]

I focus on balance in life, disregard pop-glamour and popularity, am extremely excitable- especially with the little things in life, aggressively passionate/hyper, an old soul but a kid at heart(I flip my wise-and-sophisticated-switch on with things in life that are very important, otherwise, I just like acting silly), intensely loyal, strict on myself with my morals- especially pure honesty, highly empathetic, have trouble finishing things due to my chaotic attention span, not competitive in the least, charismatic if my morals aren't crossed, I have an itch to cheer up anyone around me who seems disheartened, I'm quite impatient, have little ambition for things in life that are not an utmost priority for me, I'm highly skeptical of anything in the news or anything propelled by giant corporations, and metaphorically of course, I follow my heart but I bring my brain with me through every step of my life. 
I'm beyond happy to be married to the most incredible man in the universe. I've been with my husband for almost 10 years.

Also if you think I am ignoring you are being rude that is normally not the case. Also I am almost never trying to be cocky.

ElectricBubbles,['Ridley'],"I was born on the 4th of July, four years before the century, the fourth child of eight: four boys and four girls. I was named Elizabeth so that my parents could call me Ellie. See, we have a tradition in our family to name the kids one thing and call them by another name that has to end with an ee sound. Before me was William (Billy), Ruth (Ruthie), and Gennifer (Gennie). After me came Edmond (Eddie), Jonathan (Jonny), Grace (Gracie), and James (Jimmy). We also have a cat, Kitty, who came when Gracie was a baby. 
When I was a baby, I was either very, very happy, or very, very un-happy. Rarely was I calm or just content, except in my baby swing. This character trait has continued to this day. Im either hyper, happy, and bubbly, or Im depressed, moody, and angry. (Or, Im in a zone, and if Im in a zone, God help the person who interrupts me. Fair warning, dont interrupt me on the piano.) Rarely am I someone in between happy and sad. Does that make me bi-polar? Ill have to look that up. Ive wondered before if I have some kind of personality disorder. But in my honest opinion! I dont think some of these disorders should be called disorders, theyre just personalities. I dont like labels and boxes. I hate being told what to do or who I am. A friend asked me recently (very politely) if I might have a bit of ADD or ADHD. I dont. I think a lot of kids with ADD and ADHD really dont have a disorder problem, they have a discipline problem. Spank that kid and make him happy! Of course, thats only true in some cases. But I digress. I dont have ADD, but I must be moving to pay attention to, say, a sermon or a seminar. I actually dont have to be moving, but I need my eyes focused on something. I usually doodle. Occasionally I take notes. Sometimes I will make a cloud of words by just scribbling whatever word the speaker is saying at that time. Sometimes Ill trace my finger along something back and forth. I just need something, otherwise I will begin to daydream. Doodling doesnt mean I wont daydream, but not doodling (or something of the sort) means I certainly will! 
But I dont think I have a personality disorder. I am kind of crazy though, or people tell me I am. Why am I crazy? Does everyone have these crazy thoughts and feel like saying crazy things? I bet Im not crazy, Im just brave. Ill say things were ALL thinking! Ha! So you are crazy too! I like to think that anyway. 
Im not always crazy though, sometimes Im just plain, straight-up awkward! 
Okay, heres the actual truth. Sometimes Im a genius, sometimes Im a clutz. Sometimes Im hilarious, sometimes Im just sweet and sensitive. Sometimes I reply super quickly and say the most embarrassing things, sometimes Im more thoughtful. Sometimes Im outgoing, sometimes Im shy and very quiet. Some people say Im brilliant and a deep thinker, some people say Im shallow and naive. How can I be all of those things? Because Im a responder. I react differently to different people. Its the strangest thing. Sometimes just by the way they nod their head or phrase a question, I can feel words bubble up or simmer down. I can know two people of the same personality type and be able to communicate with only one. 
Understand, I am not being fake. Its a natural reaction. If I tried to act the same around everyone, then I would be fake. I read this on an ENFP description once. My personality type is that of an ENFP. 
See, I told you I didnt like labels, but I lied. Im a walking contradiction, and in a few moments Ill tell you why that isnt true either. First though, let me say that I love reading ENFP descriptions because I feel a deep part of me resound with the feeling of not being alone. Also, while I act different around everyone and every group, eventually, when Ive been friends with someone long enough, I find myself acting with them like I act with my siblings at home. When they still love me, I know Ive found a best friend. 
Okay, so do I contradict myself? No. I mean yes, but I dont contradict some things. I have values, morals, and mindsets that are firm. There are certain values, and I didnt choose them myself, that I cant compromise. Among those are: loyalty to friends, availability to those in need, general kindness to every person, individuality, thinking the best of every new person I meet, loving someone for who they are and like they are. I can honestly say that if I have bad feelings toward anyone, it doesnt ever settle well, ever. In general, I like people, all of them. And if I find myself disliking someone, it weighs heavy. I hate the feeling and have to get rid of it. I do. 
Yeah, thats just a few details about me. I have more, but I already lost interest in this bio.",, https://www.personalitycafe.com/members/electricbubbles.html,,,Female,[]

ENFP Kitten,"['Enfpleasantly', 'FlightlessBird', 'Mr.Adrian', 'ThomThom1']","Last-Borns:Positives: Last-borns are the world's cheerleaders. You have strong people skills and love to entertain and talk to others. You make friends easily and immediately make others feel at home. You're an extrovert, energised by the presence of other people and you're probably not afraid to take risks.Negatives: Last-borns tend to get bored quickly. They have a strong fear of rejection and a short attention span. When the fun stops, they've had enough and want to check out. To some extent they're self-centred. They may harbour unrealistic expectations of finding a relationship that is always fun - and of course, such relationships simply do not last.Babies of the family are social and outgoing, they are the most financially irresponsible of all birth orders. They just want to have a good time. Knowing that these kids love the limelight, it's no surprise to discover that Billy Crystal, Goldie Hawn, Drew Carey, Jim Carey and Steve Martin are all lastborns.Popular wisdom says that the youngest ? who never quite shakes the role of being the baby of the family ? tends to be more free-spirited, adventurous, risky, and creative.Youngest siblings often don?t have as many care-taking responsibilities and may have more freedom to do things their own way.While lastborns may be charming, they also have the potential to be manipulative, spoiled or babied to the point of helplessness.""The last born is the one who will probably still have a pet name although he's 29 and has a masters degree,"" Leman says.A lastborn who comes into a pack of already straight-and-narrow siblings might carve out her own niche by being more spunky and daring.",, https://www.personalitycafe.com/members/enfp-kitten.html,,,Female,[]

Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous? Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God/Universe. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine, as children do. We were born to make manifest the glory of God/Universe that is within us. It's not just in some of us; it's in everyone. And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same.

,,"Hi, my name is Tessa (you can call me Tess if you so choose) and I'm on this website to dig into my soul, man. Sort of. I'm a young 'un in the midst of high school. I'm going to be a writer when I'm older. (Though I'm technically one now, just not a *published* one.) One should note that in this I haven't necessarily guaranteed to be a SUCCESSFUL one, per se, but I certainly hope so, dude. 
However, with my arcane grammar knowledge (HEIL WEBSTER*), head full of ideas, and 100+ WPM, it seems that this is my fate; I feel most comfortable sitting at home, tinkering away on my laptop in a caffeinated daze while the rest of the world carries on with their business. That's just the way it is.  
I guess I don't really need to explain much about my personality, because I'm sure at this point you already know that I'm an eccentric, creative dreamer. But you won't know that I love cats and stuffed animals or that I enjoy playing the trombone.  And all animals, really are the bomb, except I don't really like bombs because they're all destructive and stuff. 
However, you probably could guess that I admire bassoons, and the flaming is in reference to their inherent coolness, not my secret desire to set them aflame and dance around the burning wood laughing maniacally. Did I just say that aloud? Freudian slip! (Flaming doesn't, incidentally, refer to a flamboyant gay man, although a gay bassoon is well within the realms of possibility because like, in German they're called ""fagotts"" or something, nuff said, plus you're blowing into a giant thing of wood. Homoerotic much?!?!?) 
On a related note, Freud is a really weird guy. Sure, he did set up the basis for modern psychology, but he was really weird. What's up with the Oedipus Complex anyway? Gross! At least I can blame his buddy Jung for coming up with the female variant, the Electra Complex. 
But the oboe is just a silly instrument. It's kind of annoying and goose-ish, even when played correctly. Don't tell any oboists that...I know one and they're quite sensitive folk, due to spending a majority of their time carving out wood and soaking it and stuff. I'd be crabby, too, if I was them. But I'm not. I'm a tromboner. (Hehehe boner. I need to stop spending time with 15 year old boys.)","Cowfuck, Wisconsin", https://www.personalitycafe.com/members/flaming-bassoon.html,Male,,,[]

,"['CrystallineSheep', 'NiTech', 'Quick']","I suck at describing myself for the most part so read some nice things my friend says about me because these are facts ;) 
According to my friend;
Unbeknownst to her, she is a very diverse person, consisting of many personality traits. She is humble, goofy, brave, smart, wise, empathetic, and strong. She has faced adversity from a very young age and still has many challenges and struggles that effect her daily. However, she continues to fight and persevere because she is hopeful and goal oriented. 
These experiences have allowed her to develop a fascinating mind that is great at observing and breaking down situations. She is able to weigh all of the information and come to the best solution or the most moral conclusion. And when new information is added, she is completely capable of objectively deducing a new ideal from that additive construct. She is aware of the fact that she isn't perfect and always strives to better herself, as well as others. No matter the situation, she tries to build her friends up. Even when bringing forth a flaw within them, she is deeply concern for their well being and would take any criticisms in stride likewise. 
This is why she is such a wise and intelligent individual. You won't find her setting unrealistic standards for others as well as standards that are above her own.  
She is extremely goofy but in a fun and humorous way. If you're ever feeling down and need a pick-me-up, she's the one to see. She can give advice and empathize with your issues, and help you feel better when it's time to move forward. She has a big heart and anyone would be lucky to have a relationship with her, be it friendship or otherwise. 
She has many interests varying from music, to observation, to anime, learning, cartoons, mystery, and video games. The list goes on. However, she can talk about anything and keep the hype going regardless of the activity or subject. 
She is the girl next door, the moral compass, the wise familiar. She is the model-the blueprint-the template of what we consider a respectable and admirable human being. You will never feel unappreciated, forgotten or worthless when in her presence, because she is your devoted rock who is more patient and reliable than most. She makes the room brighter and your heart lighter. She is and will always be a kindred spirit.",, https://www.personalitycafe.com/members/freya-violet.html,Male,Type 5,Female,[]

I read people like books, and can visually type strangers with considerable accuracy. I like those with a bona fide personality, and dislike whiny, manipulative, two-faced-ass-kissers with entitlement issues. XD

,,"I was hatched from a beautiful gray egg in the dead of night, in the light of a full moon, in the stinking humidity of a Texas' summer breath, and the first thing I did was release a terrifying scream that shook the surrounding earth within a radius of 5 miles. Naturally, it shook me out of the tree and I landed on my head. Ever since then I just haven't been right. 
I was taken in by a family of wolves that had been roving around for a nice armadillo to snack on. They had thought it was me and proceeded to start chewing me, but I had the consistency of stringy melting rubber ball and they spit me out declaring I was the nastiest thing they've ever tasted. From that day forward I was a wolf. Everything they did, I was expected to do. Whatever they ate, I ate. Whatever they played, and bounced among them. Wherever they went, I waddled along right behind them. 
With time, I grew. Not much, but I did grow in many ways. My wiry body grew thicker and sharper. My fur turned into long, sleek feathers, which was worth the awkward bald patches I was heckled for for so long. My beak became hard, my claws sharp, my eyes keen. Though mainly innate, a large part of my wit was also strengthened by my little pack. We shared the desire to hunt, but they piqued my interest in not just tactics, but true strategy. How intrinsic I became when we discovered I was creature of flight. I wasn't an odd thing for me however, to smash my cranium into the nearest pine and send its bulky seeds scattering all over my brothers and send the prey running. In time though, I was soaring high and providing a good eye to my fellow hunters. Ah, the joy that floods back when I think of us all gathered around a slain doe, them ripping into the meat, me giving an occasional good tear with my hardy beak and leaning back to gulp it all down at once. Those days couldn't last forever though. 
One morning I had came across a curious little hole, so I shuffled around it and peered in. I didn't see anything inside so I paced around it five more times while looking around then stopped, looked down, then peered in again. Well, there was still nothing to see but the hole was beckoning me. So I stuck my head in it. 
It really wasn't the best decision to say the least, my head became stuck. I looked around a bit inside and shortly after realized I couldn't pull it back out. I pulled and twisted and shoved back and forth over and over. I screamed and cried and from the outside I'm sure it looked like a strange mating dance. So much time went by and I finally just relaxed all my muscles and let my body collapse outside the hole. My eyes started closing and right when I was about to completely doze off, something started sniffing my butt; but I recognize that snout anywhere--it was the very cub I had grown up with all these years--Snoofy! I cried out in joy and he bit my butt to my alarm. ""You know me!"" ""I can't get you out any other way!"" With that he continued tugging and pulling my body every which way. He then tried digging around me, dirt kept collapsing on my head but the ground was becoming loose.  
Suddenly a shout ran out and I heard a growl. Somebody screamed and something hit Snoofy, he let out a yelp and collapsed on my legs. Again, I was alone, ants picking my skin, a soaking wet butt with clumps of dirt from Snoofy's attempt to free me.  I heard more steps behind me. Little smooth hands picked dirt around and pulled
me out. I was happy to be free, but not to be in the clutches of a little human but I was helpless. I was weak and somewhat bent up, my eyes half open due to tears and chunks of dirt stuck in them. I could barely see the girl even with evening fast approaching.  
Somehow I ended up in her backpack, in a house, in an animal shelter, in a pile of balloons, on a cruise, and halfway around the world. She was nice as well as my other captors--but they had their own ends and I had to find my pack. I've since escaped my rescuer and others too, I've zipped through power lines and fought rats with sharp claws and whips for tails. I've had many good times too, and I've enjoyed my solitary travels more than many I've had with company--but I long for the night when I'm reunited with my pack and we can scream together to the moon.",,,,Type 5w6,Female,[]

Consume me from the inside out

Hi there!  
I`m a norwegian guy working as a teacher, studying master in special pedagogics. Very interested in music, fanatically fond of remixes and the chill out/ambient genre. I am also fascinated by MBTI and spend a lot of time reading about this. According to MBTI, I am an ENFP, kind of loving that, my social life is never boring unless I want it to be.  
And as a typical ENFP, I LOVE to get to know new people, so don`t hesitate, drop me some lines :-) I don`t bite unless you want me to  The following video is my ALL TIME remix favourite!

So, now, I know who I am, why I am the way I am, and despite the fact I still work where being task oriented is part of it, I know I have my limits of how much of it I can take, so I can spend time pursuing interesting subjects, including my writing career.

The following description of the 379 was not written by me but taken from: https://www.facebook.com/Katherinefauvreconsulting/posts/1392449044409080 
The 379 
I call the 279 and the 379 the Rainbow Tritypes. They like colorful events, multi-colored images and colorful people. They are diverse and accepting and generally love people. 
These two Tritypes are very similar at first glance. However, the difference between the 3 and the 2 is important. The 279 is the most relational Tritype and the 379 is the most positive Tritype. 379s are even more positive that the 279s. They care about people like the 279 but focus more on their achievements. Both Tritypes avoid conflict and want to be upbeat...but how? 
The 279 needs easy relating and positive encounters...they try to smooth things over so people are happy and easier to be around. ;)) They focus on okness. 
The 379 needs to ""be"" an exemplar of what is positive. They are like a handful of colorful balloons. They also love images of rainbows and balloons regardless of what type leads. The 3 needs to be positive to be a success in the eyes of others...their can-do nature is motivated by what is positive to be liked. The 7 needs to be upbeat and is motivated by what is possible to be liked.The 9 needs to be comfortable and feels they must be kind and harmonious to be liked. 
So the 379 struggles when they have a disappointing experience and don't achieve their goal. They are quick to deny painful emotions in favor of pseudo happiness and turn lemons into lemonade more than any other Tritype. 
When they are down their world become bleak and gray. It is an opportunity for introspection and growth but for this Tritype it needs to be in small bites. 
So when a painful experience is chronic and needs time to heal the 379 can become impatient and very hard on themselves for being down. Like the balloons of happiness that become deflated,when in pain, the 379 can come across as shallow due to their effort to be positive when they are actually feeling despair and a sense of inner emptiness. They can feel like empty calories. 
They love people and the energy that comes from being connected to people. They like color in every form. Like flowers that turn to face the sun, 379s need the inspiration that comes from the positive feedback they receive for being good-natured. They are secretly very ambitious but seek affirmation in a quiet way. 
The 379 Tritype needs to be positive. They lose their motivation to be and become.They want success and to feel upbeat but also seek quiet stardom.",,,,Type 3w2,,['australian-percers']

I'm extremely introspective and over the years I've managed to construct a byzantine inner sanctum; a mental retreat founded on a strong sense of empathy, developed aesthetics, and an inquisitive inclination. Being so complicated inwardly, however, often translates into the following:
-clumsy
-socially awkward
-hyper-sensitive
-overly opinionated
-isolationist
Sounds really bad, but as I've grown and further developed my Fe,Ti, & Se, I've become sufficiently adept at adapting in social situations, coordinating my movements, and processing information logically as well as emotionally.

-Gamegrumps, Markiplier, PressHeartToContinue, Cr1tikal, Cryaotic
-Kitties, Birds (specifically pigeons), Puppers, all animals really
-Full Metal Alchemist
-Inuyasha
-Fullmoon wo sagashite
-Naruto
-Tf2
-Overwatch (Zenyatta is the best)
-Swearing way too much (I'm sorry)
-Kaji yuki
-uhh..Japanese culture and history?? 
-Fire emblem
-Puzzle games
-Butts
-Rune factory
-One Punch Man
-Studio Ghibli (Favorite would be Whisper of the Heart)
-Violin and Piano Covers
-Kingdom Hearts
-Deep voices
-Rhythm games
-Cinnamon rolls
-Anything sweet
-Overusing Yo Mama jokes
-Wolf Among Us 
-Steven Universe
-Summer wars
-Wolf Children

,"['Eudaimonia', 'I Kant', 'Stable Genius']","My name is Ollie and I'm an only child, which I feel is worth mentioning for some reason.  
I spend most of my time inside of my own head just thinking or on the internet keeping myself busy with who knows what. I go to school as a full time student. I tend to ramble a lot if no one stops me and I can go on and on over nothing in particular. I'm not very fond of writing ""About Me"" sections because I tend to spew garbage and too much about how I'm feeling and then feel vulnerable and erase everything (yes I did it here too). 
I really like to eat, food is just so damn yummy. It wouldn't kill me to lose 15 pounds but I'm a lazy fart. Musical artist that speak to me on a more personal level include, Jeff Buckley, The Smiths, Violent Femmes, and 30 Seconds To Mars. I like to waste my time doing nothing and get bored easily. I'm not to sure what I should be doing with my life or what I want to do either. I like pie (like a lot). I'm really socially awkward and as a result have few friends (boo!) but I've gotten pretty used to being by myself (yay?).  
I suffer from anxiety issues at times and sometimes I get stuck in these sad moods that never really last too long. I'll stop here because I'm on the verge of spewing personal information and that's lame. 
I seriously have like three tumblrs. But I'm only going to leave the link for one because I feel like this one doesn't get enough credit.

I was inactive on this site for so long now, about a year or two, but I'm back! I suddenly remembered how happy PerC used to make me, and wanted to get back on it. Hi old friends!  
I got into Myers-Briggs personality testing about a year ago and I think it's really interesting how accurate it can be. It honestly just blows my mind! I mean, I literally thought I was insane, but then I discovered the magic of ENTP's. 
I'm a pretty fun person most of the time and I'm down for some serious,  yet respectful debating. I have a pretty sarcastic sense of humor, so don't take me seriously. Internet sarcasm is a difficult thing, but I make it work. Or at least try. 
""I am so clever that sometimes I don't understand a single word of what I am saying"" ~ Oscar Wilde.... Bahahaha! Oh Oscar Wilde, you put things just right. 
Just ask anything else you'd like to know, I'm a very open person.  
And I'm on my email more than I am here, so email me anytime at quiet.girl1357@gmail.com (Don't laugh at my email... I made it on a dare and just didn't bother to make a new one).

Your core type (your strongest type) is Type 7 with a 6 wing: Type Seven individuals are energetic, engaging, and playful. They have a love for life and can easily jump from one exciting topic to the next. The Type Seven thought process is a bit scattered, but that?s because they are easily interested in many different things. This is why Type Seven is often called The Enthusiast. When in a growth state, Type Sevens become focused like Type Fives. When they?re stressed, they become a perfectionist like a Type One. The enthusiastic nature of the Type Seven combines with the cooperative nature of the Type Six, making the 7w6 a very outgoing type. 
Your second type (your next strongest type) is Type 3 with a 4 wing: Type Three individuals are self-assured, confident, and driven for success. Type Threes have a great deal of energy that propels them to excel at their chosen field, and this is why the type is often called The Achiever. Although Threes may not always like it, they?re often looked up to. Type Threes, more than any other type, are the most likely to be a workaholic. When in a state of growth, Threes become more cooperative and trusting of others, like a Type Six. When stressed, Threes become withdrawn like a Type Nine. You are a Type Three with a Four wing, which means that your energetic nature is tempered by a Four tendency to withdraw, which gives you a sense of calm that others often lack. 
Your third type (the least-used of the three) is Type 8 with a 7 wing: Eights are assertive, dominant individuals who naturally take control of situations. Eights are aggressive in satisfying their needs, and indeed, Type Eight is the most aggressive personality type in the Enneagram. When in a state of growth, Eights become like Type Twos - caring and protective of other people. When Eights are stressed, they become withdrawn and secretive like Type Fives. You're an Eight with a Seven wing, which means that the outgoing nature of Seven combines with the assertive nature of Type Eight to create one of the most dynamic types in the Enneagram. Type 8w7s are a force to be reckoned with.

I'm 28 and currently live in Gresham, Oregon. I grew up in Beaverton (a suburb to the west of Portland with a funny-sounding name) where I lived most my whole life minus the four years I was in Tacoma. WA for college.  
Me: Okay here's the hard part..describing myself. Here it goes: I I like making friends and meeting new people, although I can seem shy at first. Usually I'll most likely seem introverted until i'm comfortable around the people I'm with. Although the opposite can also be true with friends or new people. 
I love TV, movies, and music. I listen to music, watch TV shows, movies, and play video games a lot. I'm sorta dorky/nerdy. (Hence my username being a video game reference)  
I'm very sarcastic (sometimes I even sound it when I'm really not) and love joking. My sense of humour is strange. I'd call it off-beat, dark, and sometimes tasteless. I like making random references to movies, books and various other pop culture items.","Oregon, US", https://www.personalitycafe.com/members/lethal-lava-land.html,,,Male,[]

littlemoon,"['mettamorphosis', 'Robert2928']","I'm an INFP, bookish, with a love for vintage clothes, tomes, music, stuff. I'm relatively vintage myself. Like most NFs, I'm naturally warm, caring, and compassionate, yet immune to bullshit.  
I've been studying CG Jung for the last three decades, and have found his work to be invaluable. The MBTI is a great tool for understanding others as well as challenging personal growth.  
I enjoy meeting people (especially other NFs!). Despite my introversion, I love to make people laugh. I love hugs. I have a terminal illness, so I apologize if my posts are occasionally dark. I'm a very warm and gregarious person who suffers from enormous isolation - and to be honest I would be thrilled to make some friends online. 
Finally, I ought to mention that I was born male, but definitely feel like being female was my original direction. I've always found gender roles offensive and oppressive. That's life, and there's no changing it now. Living a gender role alien to me during part of the day has been...interesting, I guess. I should also mention that I'm utterly out of the dating life due to health reasons.

Scott Fitzgerald and dozens of other members of the great artistic community at Montparnasse. The phrase implies a sense of bohemianism and creativity.  ~ Gotta love it! ~ Oh, and the sixties band that adopted that name had the most fantastic music.

It's funny... I had no idea about Myers-Briggs until my best friend sent a link and suggested that I take it. I googled my results (ENFP) and from that point on, I became intrigued -- especially since the results were SPOT ON! It's definitely something I enjoy learning about in my spare time, mostly because it helps me to understand the world around me more. I'm very people-oriented and I like understanding different perspectives.  
Outside of Myers-Briggs, I would say that I am an enthusiastic, goofy person who loves to travel, read non-fiction, watch television, drink green tea, journal, and talk, talk, talk.",,,,,Female,[]

meiming8,"['Ad Astra', 'Dewymorning', 'FiddleStycks', 'Frenetic Tranquility', 'petite libellule', 'proudtobeme']","Joined this forum when, after taking the Myers-Briggs test multiple times, I finally tested as an INFJ. This realisation was incredible for me, as I had recently gone through a huge upheaval in my life and was 'discovering myself.' By accepting the label of an INFJ, I am on my way to accepting who I am (even if it is extremely painful and complex at times!) This forum and those who upkeep it are hugely beneficial in this process, and for that I am grateful to everyone here. 
My life is currently in limbo. I am waiting to graduate; once I do, I will see if I will go into the corporate world or do something completely unexpected and wild. In the meantime, my mind is overheating. My brain is a pressure cooker full of vague feelings and ideas; once I have the time they will all be released! 
In the past I was a people-pleaser and a materialistic social butterfly. Now I realise that none of these labels suit me, so I am now a gentle soul that appreciates quiet and peace. My heart is full to the brim with empathy and care for others; love beams from my heart to those I have connected with. I wish I could curl up next to them and spend the rest of my life just being near them and enjoying their presence, like a little cat basking contentedly in the sunlight. My spirit is kind but my voice is LOUD about the issues I care about!  I aim to find beauty and meaning in all that I do. I hate writing about myself because i feel self-conscious. Every time I feel inspired to write, once I'm finished I immediately want to delete everything. I'm going to control that urge...now.",, https://www.personalitycafe.com/members/meiming8.html,,Unknown,Female,[]

ESTJs are evil in a frank and blunt manner; without realising it. You get them off track by evoking emotions and making them believe there is a conspiracy. 
The ENTJ is evil in an unpredictable, sophisticated and even scheming way. You get them off track by assigning a lot of detailed work and be very thorough in follow-up on details on whatever they say or deliver.

,,"I think that personality theories are somewhat pseudo-scientific and should be explored lightly, but I do view them as useful tools for personal advancement and psycho-social understanding. While I feel that theories discussed here have potential to be used in egotistical ways that may be psychologically damaging, I think that the Enneagram is useful in identifying the motivations and poisonous thoughts (as a key founder stated them) that drive people and are particularly helpful for spiritual :P advancement, but in a less concrete way as explained by the overall theory itself, and that the MBTI is valuable in identifying how people interact and view themselves socially. Individuals are immensely more complex than can be explained by a central instinct/fear or guiding 'cognitive function'. Although they should be taken lightly, I do think theories such as the MBTI, Socionics and the Enneagram are nonetheless useful as indicators of personality and (more importantly) as methods of understanding psychological problems, and I am grateful that places like personalitycafe exist as open and understanding arenas of exploration in the human psyche.  
Nonetheless:

Mark Novbett,['Sose Husserl'],"If you do not want what I want, please try not to tell me that my want is wrong.  
Or if my beliefs are different from yours, at least pause before you set out to correct them. 
Or if my emotion seems less or more intense than yours, given the same circumstances, try not to ask me to feel other than I do. 
Or if I act, or fail to act, in the manner of your design for action, please let me be. 
I do not, for the moment at least, ask you to understand me. That will come only when you are willing to give up trying to change me into a copy of you. 
If you will allow me any of my own wants, or emotions, or beliefs, or actions, then you open yourself to the possibility that some day these ways of mine might not seem so wrong, and might finally appear as right?for me. To put up with me is the first step to understanding me. 
Not that you embrace my ways as right for you, but that you are no longer irritated or disappointed with me for my seeming waywardness. And one day, perhaps, in trying to understand me, you might come to prize my differences, and, far from seeking to change me, might preserve and even cherish those differences. 
I may be your spouse, your parent, your offspring, your friend, your colleague. But whatever our relation, this I know: You and I are fundamentally different and both of us have to march to our own drummer.

-Toronto, ON, Canada ( for now :P ). 
How did I end up here?
-Hm, good question.. it's fate! :P 
What do I do?
-I'm trying to take over the world. Yes, I am. DON'T LAUGH! *cough* It's a serious matter. 
Other than that, i've been in a lot of places in such a short time of my life. I'm 24 and loving life! I've been and lived in over 3-4 different countries. I have friends from so many places and so many of them that i can't recall half of them x_x But the interesting memories don't disappear! I have experienced so many different perspectives to things up and down, growing up with so many different people. And moving on with my life, I will always cherish them, whoever it is with; you know who you are! 
Every encounter in life can be meaningful if you make it that way. 
Currently residing in Canada and working on taking over the world and will be here for some time. *cough* 
As you can see, currently i am bored and i've decided to write a journal for you to read and amuse yourself. However, i'll draw an end to this atrocity before you fall too madly in love with me.

Hi!:) I've been surfing around on forums & such for a while now, and for whatever reason, I had a sudden urge to create an account on here.  So here I am. 
I love people, and I love to talk about anything and everything.  If someone wants to tell me their entire life story or just ask me a question, PLEASE pm me! That would be awesome! 
I spend most of my time reading, writing, studying film/music (some from the present, much from the past), and studying world cultures.  I am also a huge fan of animation. 
If I could be anywhere right now, it would be in Hallerbos forest in Belgium (the picture in my profile), sitting beneath a tree completely and utterly alone, sketching a roe deer.",, https://www.personalitycafe.com/members/retrospectacles.html,,Type 5w4,Female,[]

I believe more people should take the time to learn more about themselves and try to become more complete as a person. 
I can be quite emotionally sensitive and expressive at times, especially with those I feel comfortable with; which naturally tends to be Perceiving types (especially Feelers). 
I find great meaning in My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic. It's really changed me as a person and my outlook on life and what I value. 
I am quite optimistic about people in general. I'm the kind of person that tries to see the good in everyone, and humanity in general. 
I'm very much a cat person, I like most things which are cute and cuddly!
My favourite kind of music tends to be purely instrumental/electronic. I especially like video game soundtracks and melodic progressive house. Though I especially like Ellie Goulding's music.

To me, a lot of traditional views are either a. lacking character/downright boring; b. no longer apply to the ever-changing world; c. something I find myself disagreeing with a lot; or d. I think there's a better fashion in how to run the show. There are few traditions in this world that I know of with which I see eye-to-eye but don?t feel like discussing here, as my profile would become more of a novel than a brief idea of who I am as a person. 
I don't care about socializing with a lot of people if I find them to be some sort of incompetent fool or I'm just awkward around them because I'm not comfortable around them; either one of those two or it's just that no one around cares to talk about things I enjoy discussing.  
I am a pretty accepting and understanding person for the most part, but this does NOT mean I am going to accept everything someone says or does. Also, this does not mean that I am going to be accepting of everyone. What this means is that I am open to others' views if they're credible to me. It is all about HOW you present your views to me, not so much WHAT your views are. So, if you find yourself wondering why I turned your views away without question or am ""being stubborn and not listening to your so called 'wisdom'"", you can count on that being why.  
I like arguing for the sakes of arguing! This is because I can be a competitive person. No, I?m not all into physical competition but rather I like intellectual discussions or even debates? as long as I know what the hell I?m talking about in regards to the topic at hand (and related things of course).  
If there's one thing that REALLY sickens me about people the most, it's short-sightedness. Again, everyone slips up here and there, perhaps they will do something impulsive or just downright idiotic; even I don't always think things through all the way (no one does 100% of the time). Those who just can't think about the future at all are the ones that I just can't get along with one bit. Even though I like to think of past memories, I LOVE to ponder about the possibilities, and in that the future a lot more than I show/discuss.  
One day, I want to invent something that will improve the quality of life for the human population (I have some ideas that I don't want to share on here :P). In this, I highly value innovation and creativity because I feel that without those 2 things, we would still be in the stone age to this day and people would still live only until they are 35 years old or so.  
I also value mental competence. Ok, I understand that people, including myself, make silly mistakes and do stupid things; however, if one is intelligent enough, I feel that they will be able to learn from their mistakes and change for the future to prevent further mistakes of similar or the same nature. If you cannot learn from your own mistakes at all or just don?t care to do so, then I do not wish to associate myself with you. In other words, I get uptight with truly stupid people. 
Another thing I highly value in myself along with others is the ability to understand him-or-herself (introspection). When I get to know people, they really should know who they are as a person. It may take some thinking but it?s not really hard to understand why you: are interested in the things you are; are attracted to the people you?re attracted to; why you feel the way you do about some things or why you?re in a particular mood; why you think the way you do; why you perceive things the way you do; etc. 
It really disappoints me when I?m trying to get to know someone by asking questions such as ?why do you like that?? and all they say is ?because I just do?. How do you expect others to know you if you don?t even know you? It?s pretty ridiculous to expect others to understand you if you don?t understand yourself.  
In my personal opinion, lying about who you are/not being yourself is downright pointless to me; if you're lying to protect yourself or someone else, it's one thing (if it?s a good cause done for a good reason). Otherwise, you're lying to yourself in the end.  
I do not respond in a particularly desirable way to others attempting to control me via testing my guilt or fear factors. Many people have tried to control me by trying to place guilt or fear on me and believe me they didn't get the results they liked. I am not one to be controlled anyways, although I can follow rules if they are logical and just make sense to me. As I like to say, others may steer the boat but only I am the captain to my ship. 
Another thing that really bothers me about some people is when they feel the need to use ?sophisticated? vocabulary terms in casual conversation. When I think of socializing with others in a casual setting, you should be on the same page. Save the whole competition thing for circumstances where there is reason to be competitive. If you?re trying to impress others with your vocabulary and thus trying to look more educated than those you are socializing casually with, that to me shows insecurity and shows that person?s inability to hold a real conversation with others. No wonder people don?t like being around those type of people. If you?re like that, no wonder people don?t like you! That?s how I feel about it anyways.   
If/when I find someone I want to be with for the rest of my life or at least a pretty long time, I really do hope that this person knows how to manage their time properly and learns that work/school isn't their whole life. I mean honestly, if you expect someone to understand you care about them and such, make some effort to spend quality time together. I find it so funny when people decide to get married, yet when they spend little time together they wonder why their marriage life sucks so much @$$. 
Also, I need someone who is going to be able to have the time or at least be able to MAKE the time to give me a call not just send a text message or when they know I'm upset to actually tend to me right then and there, not holding onto that thought until they're done with work or school or even a game. I'm sorry but making someone wait for comfort and love is just so loser-like. Just sayin'.

I spent 2 years studying business at CSUCI, only to realize that I wasn't into it at all... which is WEIRD, because I'm still really into business pursuits... I went to a CC for a while and then decided that I wanna study philosophy... its always been a hobby of mine, even before I knew what it was.  The main problem is, the excitement is wearing off... I hope that I can motivate myself to finish. ahahaha... but yes, other than school, i DO have a pretty awesome life.  I have tons of friends and enemies.... the enemies make life just as interesting as the friends... usually gain the enemies by being TOO ENFP and they can't deal, but thats a topic for another bio.  I am also really into music.  My dream is to be in a successful rock band.  People say its a pipe dream, but I'm not so sure... half of success is having connections, which im very good at making, so we'll see.

,,"Evil is a Passionate Lover   
Finished with sadness,
I turn my Soul from familiar smells
And Primal comforts.
Fight the overwhelming pull
Of Habit and Time,
perfumed smoke, casual stomping
of unripened worth,
sexual awareness before awareness of sex. 
Come here, child. Learn from me.
Don't lie there and barter dignity for touch,
holiness for a momentary tribute to existence.
Sanctity for seminal fluid, and obstinate callouses. 
Run your mental fingers over the back of my experience.
Feel the welts. Slowly...Yes. Oh,That, that was a bad one. ..
Time has changed their appearance.
But I have changed their effect.
Dwell on the pain but briefly,
for I have high hopes for you, my child. 
Be afraid of evil. It does exist.
Into His eyes I looked .
Inhuman slits of black.
You think I jest?!
When the eyes become coal,
there is no more pleading,
There is no human behind the mask.
The Pain will now commence.
By what machinations?
He swirls up your body like sensuous smoke,
then materializes
with a death grip on your heart.
Evil is a passionate lover. 
Stay away from the bad boys. Keep from dark corners. Mark thy doorpost of chastity bright red. Then, maybe, my sweet child, this angel of death will passover.",, https://www.personalitycafe.com/members/simonecarmen.html,Male,Type 9w1,Female,[]

SilveryLine,['ShadoWolf'],"I love to observe and learn. About what you may ask? Well, basically everything. I'm like a sponge I just soak up everything, because of this I have a pretty good memory. As for my friends we're all nerds and proud of it. We all talk about fandoms, life, the ""what-if's"" of life, and other things like that. I love them like a second family. Speaking of family I have a nice one. There's my Mom and Dad and my younger brother. I don't know exactly what personality types my parents are but my brother is an ISTJ we're okay as far as bro/sis relationships go. I know there are some who pull pranks on each other and some who just bully and ridicule for no good reason. I don't like pranks or bullying and neither does my bro so we look out for each other instead. I don't normally call him ""bro"" though, but in this case it's a nice subsitute. Yeah I like a little slang here and there but I'm not a neadrathal... I hope that's how you spell it. If not I apologize I'm really rushing here. Why is my computer still loading it's been on for five hours!!! How I love/hate technology. I joined personality cafe because I thought I could learn more about my thoughts as well as other personality types. I prefer these kinds of labels rather than the dreadful stereotypes society makes out of nowhere. I still have faith in the human race, but as for reality tv I've completely given up. So after taking three tests I discovered I'm an INFP which means I got my head and feet in the clouds, I'm creative, and I like to help people. Very true. That's not all that's just the bare bones of INFP's if you want to learn more you should look it up if you're interested. If you want to ask me a question about INFP's or something of the like you can message me if you want but keep it appropriate please. Yeah that's it, I hope to learn more about personality types and so on and so forth. Until next time.",, https://www.personalitycafe.com/members/silveryline.html,,,Female,[]

Although I take a while to open up to people as I am generally  quiet. But trust me, with friends I am hardly that. I would describe myself as creative, intuitive, open minded, a deep thinker, a little stubborn, introverted, soft spoken, kind and not very good at keeping organized and on time.

                                          -(modified) poem by me     
Hello, there. The name's Dea (Day-uh), if you don't feel like constantly pronouncing the scientific name of a moth family.  ;) 
Feel free to chat if you'd like. I promise, I'm friendly. Though if you can't handle a bit of weird, you may want to reconsider socializing with me.  
Anyway, I'm here because I've developed a heavy interest in psychological traits and behavior, and enjoy finding ways to connect them. 
One thing I must emphasize about myself-- 
I am never done learning.  
Research is my foundation. I have a heavy obsession with statistics and charts. In this regard, I view it as art, and art, in turn, becomes the artist. This is an unending mutuality.  
I have plenty of other interests too. I love nature and value solitude (to the point that it might as well be a long-term hobby). I also enjoy dissecting and repairing broken electronics. I'm certified in PC repair.  
Hey, we all have that one 'off' interest.  
Though, warning--whatever you have to say to me has the potential to fall victim to a ~90% chance of being over-analyzed, sifted, filtered, and steeped, being saved for that one ridiculously improbable situation I might encounter where what I've learned might actually make a constructive impact while the blatant every-day chance to use it goes over my head while I'm busy with self-reflecting and hermitizing. 
In other words.... my analytical tendency is evil.   
Now that that's out of the way, if you still care to chat, have at it. If you have any questions, ask. Don't be afraid to. I generally answer, but I'd probably die if I had to be the one to initiate the conversation.  
Well, beyond this point, I'm not quite sure what to say, so I'll list some of my favorite quotes:  
?My friend, I am not what I seem. Seeming is but a garment I wear ? a care-woven garment that protects me from thy questionings and thee from my negligence.
The ?I? in me, my friend, dwells in the house of silence, and therein it shall remain forever more, unperceived, unapproachable.? -Kahlil Gibran

I'm a Canadian ENTJ, 8w9/3w2/6w5, tritype 836 The Justice Fighter, so/sp. Married, 14 years together with an ISFP 9w8/2w1/6w7, tritype 926 The Good Samaritan, so/sp.  
Fictional relationships that portray similar dynamics include:
Raynor/Kerrigan (Starcraft)
Wall-E/Eve (Pixar)
Hercules/Megara (Disney)
Arnold/Helga (Hey Arnold)
Archer/Rin (Fate Stay Night)
Silverbolt/Black Arachnia (Beast Wars)
I am resolute and bold, while he is gentle and steady.  
The Languages of Love I respond most to are: Acts of Service and Gifts, and least to Verbal Affirmations. Walk the walk. My cognitive function stack looks like this by strength (not preference): Te, Si, Ti, Se, Ni, Fi, Ne, Fe.  
I'm an inked moto-girl. I ride a Kawasaki Ninja 300 alongside my husband who rides a Kawasaki Ninja 636. I listen to a healthy mix of classic, alternative and indie rock. Foo Fighters, Muse, Metallica, Nirvana, Godsmack, Rammstein, Eminem, Rihanna, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Coldplay to name a few. 
I appreciate the finer things in life; luxury shoes and accessories namely. Christian Louboutin, Hermes, Chanel, and Cartier are my favourite designer houses. My personal fashion style is classic with an edge - clean lines, textures, spikes, leather, buckles, and most types of hardware. My favourite colour is gold, though, blood red is also acceptable (blood is the new pink), followed by other jewel tones of deep green, purple or blue. 
I am a mother to a boy and a master to two lovable but very carnivorous felines. I'm a huge advocate of raw-feeding for both cats and dogs, without exception. That's right, my cats eat flesh and bones on the daily.  
I enjoy TV and movies, dining out, and retail therapy as a typical city girl does. But, in the summer, I love to fish, camp, go on road trips, and explore nature. I also happen to be a geek. I used to play MMORPGs and other video games religiously and spent several years as a gamemaster to a large community and forum-modded on several sites. I enjoy a broad spectrum of game genres (a few titles to note: Quake 2, Halo, Starcraft, Command and Conquer, Ragnarok Online, The Sims, and a crapton of Facebook/phone games). Additionally, I take strategy board and card games very seriously, especially ones that require tactical thinking and cooperative play (bonus if its difficult to win). These are but all tools to develop my skills. At the moment, I am playing Mafia on PerC to work on my Ni. I enjoy leadership roles as moderator or gamemaster holding community events and enforcing policy. 
When it comes to media, I can't get enough of endless suffering. Catharsis is huge for me. Shows like Game of Thrones, Sons of Anarchy, Downton Abbey and The Walking Dead are right up my alley. I look for unpredictable plot, realistic characters, and power plays. My favourite characters are usually strong and polarizing: Cersei Lannister, Tywin Lannister, Daenerys Targaryen, Lady Olenna (Game of Thrones); The Governor, Carol (The Walking Dead), Tara Knowles (Sons of Anarchy), Lagertha (Vikings), Lady Mary Crawley (Downton Abbey), Cristina Yang (Grey's Anatomy), Charlotte King (Private Practice), Dottie Underwood, Agent Carter (Agent Carter). I generally enjoy period dramas. 
I describe myself as independent, reliable, and efficient. But if you're unlucky (or a moron), then I will be unabashedly condescending, cruel and judgmental. I am a feminist and I am passionate about reproductive rights, gender equality, affirmative action and other social justice issues. Additionally, I am ambitious and believe in follow-through.  I have little respect for those who don't. 
I do not tolerate the below traits very well, so it be best to stay out of my way if it applies to you:
- inefficiency
- lack of focus
- trolling
- tardiness
- excuses and apologies
- being too sensitive
- indecisiveness
- lack of follow through and flakiness
- smokers/recreational drug users of any kind
- loaded/emotive language and rhetoric
- inability to see one's own racist/sexist biases

Most of the time I have my nose in a book of some sort, most likely non-fiction, or watching some sort of tv series. It is my drive for knowledge that leads me to books, the pages filled with an abundance of knowledge just waiting for me. I have a passion for activism and social justice. I try in my every day life to live with an environmental focus, a kind heart and compassion to those I met. I am an understanding person and I do not tolerate rudeness or judgmental people. I also have a rebellious nature. I like to question what I am told and am not good with authority, it?s probably because I don?t believe in hierarchy.","Ontario, Canada",,,Type 2,Female,[]

That's the beauty of Jesus Christ's work on the cross, and I make it my mission to be completely myself through Him and to be as loving and accepting as possible of everyone, no matter what they believe or think of me. 
If you need to know anything about God, it's that he loves you more than you will ever be able to know or understand, and he is able and willing to rescue you, and to know and be known by you, because of what his Son has done for you, and for all of us. 
Joy is free and available, if you will accept it.  If you don't, I won't think less of you.  I just desperately hope, for your sake, that you understand what you're walking away from before you say no.  Jesus's call is not to be taken lightly.

DynamicShadow,[],"I am shrewdly clever, intuitive, imaginative, and insatiably curious. I'm also a bit narcissistic, spontaneous, neurotic, ADD, and habitually late. 
I have an incredible amount of passion for all things interesting to me, which happens to be a lot of things. Although I see all shades of gray, my actions tend to be black or white.... All or nothing.... Hell or glory... This ties back to my ridiculous amount of Ne that needs constant input, coupled with low sensing. A few things that top the list are music, movies, TV, technology, psychology, sociology, strategy, and I'm a big futurist. I see all the possibilities of the world, its potential, and sometimes it leads to incredible ideas or conviction... Sometimes it breaks my heart. 
Knowing the possible (yet not actual) is a blessing and a curse. I can dream up great ideas for upcoming changes, but I also carry the burden of knowing where we could be as people, and I can't help but feel angry, broken hearted, and powerless. I try to channel that emotion into action, instead of whining, but I'm not perfect, LOL. 
This is probably the longest I've gone without throwing in some type of sarcasm into what I'm saying. Sarcasm and obscure references are a part of my vernacular.","Houston, TX", https://www.personalitycafe.com/members/dynamicshadow.html,Female,Unknown,Male,[]

She says that beginnings are scary, endings are usually sad, but it's the middle that counts the most.  I have my moments ... I love God ... I have three children but I really wanted four and expect that someday (one way or another) God will bless me with another ... I love my husband in a way I never thought possible ... I am forgiven ... I am an only child ... my father died when I was 20 ... I love horses and hope my last moment is with one in a forest ... I want to be buried near a mint field because the smell reminds me of those hot summers filled with 4-H, horse drill & rodeoing ... I am a school volunteer ... I plan to earn a PhD someday and write an entire book on a new communication theory I have yet to think of ... I am a writer and graphic designer and it happens to afford me many luxuries ... I believe we all have a civic duty in some form and if you aren't doing something about it, you should be ... I know things I shouldn't and more so than not it gets me in trouble ... I spoil my youngest child ... I vote because men and women fought a long, hard battle for that right ... I have been blessed ...

I love being outdoors and working with my hands.  I am happiest when I am physically busy.  My comfort zone includes activities that challenge me while I am alone such as kayaking and hiking.  I pushed myself outside of my comfort zone by joining Toastmasters International and after two years of honing my skills I now coordinate my department?s public speaking class.  It was a scary thing to start but I feel very comfortable doing it now. 
I?ve recently begun volunteering with a youth leadership group to teach public speaking skills, environmental management, sustainability and kayaking.

Then announce in horror: ""You're one of THEM"" - and back away slowly7) SAY -DING at each floor.8) SAY ""I wonder what all these do?"" And push all the red buttons.9) MAKE explosion noises when anyone presses a button.10) STARE, grinning at another passenger for a while, then announce: ""I have new socks on.""11) WHEN the elevator is silent, look around and ask: ""Is that your beeper?""12) TRY to make personal calls on the emergency phone.13) DRAW a little square on the floor with chalk and announce to the other passengers: ""This is my personal space.""14) WHEN there's only one other person in the elevator, tap them on the shoulder, then pretend it wasn't you.15) PUSH the buttons and pretend they give you a shock. Smile, and go back for more.16) ASK if you can push the button for other people but push the wrong ones.17) HOLD the doors open and say you're waiting for your friend. After a while, let the doors close and say ""Hi Greg, How's your day been?""18) DROP a pen and wait until someone reaches to help pick it up, then scream: ""That's mine!""19) BRING a camera and take pictures of everyone in the lift.20) PRETEND you're a flight attendant and review emergency procedures and exits with the Passengers.21) SWAT at flies that don't exist.22) CALL out ""Group hug"" then enforce it.---------------------------------------------------------------------","Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, Australia", https://www.personalitycafe.com/members/kaseyturpeinen.html,,Type 9w1,,[]

khalitzbonn,[],"Like their fellow SPs, ISTPs are fundamentally Performers (note the capital 'P' :-)), but as Ts their areas of interest tend to be mechanical rather than artistic like those of ISFPs, and unlike most ESPs they do not present an impression of constant activity. On the contrary, they lie dormant, saving their energy until a project or an adventure worthy of their time comes along--and then they launch themselves at it. The apparently frenzied state that inevitably ensues is actually much more controlled than it appears--ISTPs always seem to know what they're doing when it comes to physical or mechanical obstacles--but the whole chain of events presents a confusing and paradoxical picture to an outsider.ISTPs are equally difficult to understand in their need for personal space, which in turn has an impact on their relationships with others. They need to be able to ""spread out""--both physically and psychologically--which generally implies encroaching to some degree on others, especially if they decide that something of someone else's is going to become their next project. (They are generally quite comfortable, however, with being treated the same way they treat others--at least in this respect.) But because they need such a lot of flexibility to be as spontaneous as they feel they must be, they tend to become as inflexible as the most rigid J when someone seems to be threatening their lifestyle (although they usually respond with a classic SP rage which is yet another vivid contrast to their ""dormant,"" impassive, detached mode). These territorial considerations are usually critical in relationships with ISTPs; communication also tends to be a key issue, since they generally express themselves non-verbally. When they do actually verbalize, ISTPs are masters of the one-liner, often showing flashes of humor in the most tense situations; this can result in their being seen as thick-skinned or tasteless.Like most SPs, ISTPs may have trouble with rote and abstract classroom learning, which tend not to be good measures of their actual intelligence. They tend, sometimes with good reason, to be highly skeptical of its practical value, and often gravitate towards classes in industrial arts; part-time vocational/ technical programs can be useful to even the college-bound ISTP. In terms of careers, mechanics and any of the skilled trades are traditional choices, and those ISTPs with strong numerical as well mechanical gifts tend to do extremely well in most areas of engineering. Working as paramedics or firefighters can fulfill the ISTP need to live on the edge; they are at their best in a crisis, where their natural disregard for rules and authority structures allows them to focus on and tackle the emergency at hand in the most effective way.ISTPs with more sedate careers usually take on high-risk avocations like racing, skydiving, and motorcycling. While aware of the dangers involved, they are so in touch with the physical world that they know they can get away with much smaller safety margins than other types.","A, A", https://www.personalitycafe.com/members/khalitzbonn.html,,Type 7,Male,[]

Quotes I like:
Never confuse kindness with weakness.
Sometimes it's better to format a sentence as a question rather than a statement or order - it will be more effective in achieving your means.
Live and let live. 
Listen -> pause -> respond - you'll learn more from people and get along with them better if you make an active effort to do this.
Most people need to figure it out on their own; you can't give them the answer but you can set a good example and lead them to the answer

betted60,[],"""A few details""? If you know an ENTJ, you know that's impossible. Well, I'm very intense, interested in all sorts of things from science to Christianity to Science Fiction to discussing principles and concepts to English (I teach English to my pastor's grandchildren). And I discover something new about my own language frequently (did you know there is a rule about how you pronounce ""ed"" at the end of a past-tense word? I didn't either until 5-6 years ago). I love airplanes and trains (should I add automobiles to match the movie???) I love architecture, especially here in Guadalajara, Mexico. I love to travel but don't get around easily like I used to. I've been in 34 countries, 39 American states (not counting being in an airport), and 17 Mexican states. I'm interesting, intelligent, uber-outgoing (no surprise to you), funny, even silly sometimes, intellectual, glass 3/4 full person but am learning to see the negative side of things when necessary, intensely interested in people. I love to read. Current favorite author is Diana Gabaldon who writes the Outlander books (now a series on Starz), but read in many genres and types (science, Christian, psychology, etc. etc.) of writings--even cereal boxes if you put one in front of me. I'm constantly reading Spanish signs out loud when going down the street--much to the chagrin of my bi-lingual taxi driver, or the puzzlement of the neighbor I walk by. Used to play volleyball and was pretty good for a 5'2"" (now more like 5') woman. I love to walk though my body does NOT agree with that statement.",, https://www.personalitycafe.com/members/betted60.html,,Unknown,Female,[]

Rob Cookenour,,"I've lived in Boones Creek since birth and have no plans to move away. Unlike areas further north or south, Boones Creek has just enough of a winter, spring, summer and fall. Some areas of the country only have one dominate season and a little bit of a second one, that's it! As far as the west or mid-west regions, Boones Creek has just the right size mountains and valleys along with several flat plain areas, too. There's not too many places in America where you can leave your home for work and pass a farm complete with a barn and cows while in just in minutes you will be amid the city and all it offers. Boones Creek . . . 10 minutes from any environment.
 I value my education and especially my health. I put plenty of effort into trying to maintain a healthy image and plenty of strength for playing hard and working harder for many years to come. I have stayed free of drugs, alcohol, cigs, and any other tobacco use thanks to being busy with hobbies and sports. I just don't like something because it is the norm. I like what I like . . . because I like it.
 I have fun: working with hand tools whether building or digging, capturing video and editing into movies, photography, improving computer performances, graphic design, audio editing, and any empty ball field waiting on some people to play baseball/softball.

Love can make you immortalSo, a little about me...Well Im nothing special, I havent lived a glamorous life, never had the nicest of things, and Ive been in some hard times. But I'm not complaining in the least bit. My past and all Ive been through has made me the strong person I am today. I am so blessed to have what I have now. I have dreams, small dreams, nothing big and out there. But they are something I know one day will be a reality, as some of them already are. Im proud of the person I am, proud of the things I have, and grateful for the people in my life. I stand up for what I believe in, I dont conform to fit in, and I speak my mind when necessary( and sometimes when it isnt) Im stubborn, have very little patience, hate admitting Im wrong, and I let my feelings get hurt way to easily. But hey Im not perfect and atleast I can admit that. I have an amazing husband, Corey Hunnicutt,  hes the absolute best thing to have ever happened to me. He saved me when I desperately needed it, and gave me a family that I adore and couldnt be more thankful for. I could go on and on about him, but this is About me, not him. lol. I tend to ramble about the things I love. I consider myself an artsy person, I love decorating, drawing, painting, designing, etc. It makes me happy (among other things). Im a nerd, and proud of it. I could sit and play a good RPG or shooter game for hours. I love taking care of people, being able to fix them some food give them a place to stay or just some advice, knowing that I have helped them in some way brings me a sense of contentment, & saying that, if you ever want to chat or vent, Im a good listener. Just shoot me a msg:) But a guess this is all I have to say. All I have to offer is myself and nothing more.","Aliceville, Alabama, United States", https://www.personalitycafe.com/members/brooke-hunnicutt.html,,,,[]

If it isn't understood or I have trouble relating then it will bother me until I do or I will drop it until I have had time to think on it and reevaluate or dismiss it all together.  I thoroughly enjoy a conversation that utilizes deep thinking, however it is such a blast to have a goofy conversation full of nothing, made up silly's and laughs.  
Everyday talk about the weather tends to send me into a world of boredom and yawns.

Dreams, illusion, abstract thought and the mysterious are all governed by Neptune.""""Neptune does have its showier side, as it rules movies, television, theater, fashion and all forms of glamour. In essence, Neptune is creating an illusion -- of what is enchanting on the outside and captivating within. Neptune has a mystique which doesn't reveal itself easily. It can be a poser, too, dabbling in flattery -- and subversion.The shadow side of Neptune is akin to the aging star who cannot make one more curtain. When the lights are low, this planet plays in a netherworld of drugs, alcohol, trances and hypnosis. Neptunian energy reeks of escapism on its darker days, a sea of delusion, hypochondria and abnormality. Sleep and dreams are also lorded over by this planet."" https://www.astrology.com/astrology-101/planets/neptune""Neptune is a symbol of the universal truth that all life is connected. In mythology, Neptune is the god of the sea... He dissolves boundaries and structures considered to be reality; therefore, reality and unreality are sometimes difficult to distinguish in this area. A desire to escape reality through fantasy or other means is common with Neptune.It is this blurring of boundaries that is Neptune?s greatest gift, however. A strong Neptune indicates creative gifts, deep empathy and compassionate understanding of others.""- http://www.mollysastrology.com/astrology-tutorials/neptune""Neptune, associated with universal love, is said to be the higher octave of Venus, which rules individual love. Neptune represents the universal ocean of oneness with all beings. Therefore, Neptune is highly compassionate, idealistic, and imaginative.""- https://www.astrograph.com/learning-astrology/neptune.phpside note: No, I don't take astrology seriously, and it's been awhile since I was into it.

nool,[],"I'm an INTP and consistently test as such. I'm less interested in the enneagram but I've tested both as a 5w6 and a 9, which means I'm likely the former (in any case, very conflict avoidant). I can see both sides of most arguments, but am dismissive of emotional reasoning except when I can see its relevance. I consider myself extremely skeptical, although I maintain tact and try not to push my opinions on others, but will freely share them when prompted (I have many, but few of them are hardened). This being said, I am also skeptical of Jungian psychology and the like, but from a social perspective I think typology is very useful for understanding possible thought processes and points of view of others. I've decided to join this forum because I find some of the conversations really interesting and am hoping to learn more about how myself and others function in a broad sense, and maybe improve my social skills (I sometimes have trouble with new people).To go over my profile in a bit more detail, I suffer from social anxiety and depression, but am still very much capable of functioning well socially when I am at social gatherings. However, I'm also capable of playing up parts of my personality to be the person certain people will like, so I'm kind of this paradoxically reclusive social chameleon. People really seem to like me, but even when the feeling is mutual I often have difficulty reaching out to them.I am a left-wing, homosexual, cisgendered, agnostic male from southern Ontario. I am the youngest of several siblings, and generally have very mixed emotions about most people, especially my own family members. I am two years into a very happy relationship with an INFJ. I am an awful procrastinator, but usually able to get high grades anyway. Recently, I left my country's top university 2/3 through my BA to pursue a career in welding. I was originally hoping to be a copy editor or librarian, but after meeting people in those fields I could tell I wasn't interested in the stress of competing for very rare positions and then, if successful, constantly fearing my job being declared excess. I like RPGs and music, playing a few instruments privately and singing, and listening to lots of sad indie music, psychedelic rock, funk, and all their offshoots. Theres more I could say, but I shouldn't blather on anymore.Functionally,I fluctuates from slightly to fairly stronger than E.N is consistently quite stronger than ST is slightly to moderately stronger than FP is always extremely higher than J - usually over 90%.",,,,,Male,[]

norwegianmouse,[],"You are a Type 4 with a 5 wing: ""The Bohemian""Your trifix is 4w5, 6w5, 1w9.In enneagram theory, you have one type for how you relate to the world (either 8, 9, or 1), one type for how you think (5, 6, 7) and one type for how you see yourself (2, 3, 4.) Your tri-fix contains one number from each of these triads. They are listed in the order of how strongly they present in your personality. Your core type (your strongest type) is Type 4 with a 5 wing: Type Four individuals are intensely emotionally aware, and often retreat to their rich inner world of concepts and ideas. They are the most artistic type in the Enneagram and driven to create their own, unique identity. Type Fours value authenticity highly and express themselves whenever they can. They are one of the most individualistic types in the Enneagram. Type Fours, when in a state of growth, become principled like Type Ones. When stressed, Type Fours can become clingy like an unhealthy Type Two. You are a Type Four with a Five wing, which means that the individualist nature of a Four combines with the cerebral nature of a Five to make you one of the most creative types in the Enneagram.Your second type (your next strongest type) is Type 6 with a 5 wing: Type Six individuals are reliable, committed, and security-oriented. They are natural troubleshooters, and are always aware of potential problems. This makes the Type Six anxious, but the anxiety fuels them to resolve their problems. They can range from loyal to rebellious, depending on where they get their security from ? if the security is from within, they can be very defiant? if it comes from others, they can be very cooperative and devoted. When a Type Six is in a growth state, they become calm like a Type Nine. When they are stressed, they can become arrogant like an unhealthy Type Three. You are a Type Six with a Five wing, which means that the committed nature of the Six combines with the cerebral nature of the Type Five. As a result, you often excel at concrete thinking and troubleshooting.Your third type (the least-used of the three) is Type 1 with a 9 wing: Type One individuals have a very finely tuned sense of right and wrong, and they chart the course of their lives by following a righteous path. This doesn?t have to be religious? it can be any set of principles that the Type One finds ethical. Ones are perfectionists, often setting high standards for themselves and others. Type One may very well be the most noble type in the Enneagram. When a Type One is in a state of growth, they become excited and joyous like a Seven. When a Type One is stressed, they become emotional and overwhelmed like an unhealthy Type 4. You are a Type One with a Nine wing, which means that the righteous traits of a Type One combine with the peaceful nature of the Type Nine to create a very idealistic personality.Some words that describe you: principled, moralistic, perfectionist, self-critical, creative, unique, authentic, emotional, loyal, reliable, anxious, skeptical.",North-East Ohio,,Female,,Male,"['Sex and Relationships', 'Intro', 'Blog']"

Any interesting story behind that? United States- If you could get up and go anywhere in the world at the present moment, where would you go and why? Not necessarily at the present moment, but in a few years I would like to travel to Japan and some countries in Scandinavia (after I learn more of their respective languages).Age - How old are you? Do you think you act your age? If not, explain which age you think you resemble most. Do it for the laughs. Within the stereotypical college age range. As with most people around my age, I also believe that I act older than my age, probably around 5-10 years older since I tend to associate most closely with teachers, some graduate students (PhD), and professors.Personal(ity) ~* What is your Myers-Briggs personality type and for how long have you been reading on personality theory? INTJ* What type do you usually test as? INFJ, since they generally confuse my relatively high Fi.* What are your favorite and least favorite personality types to be around? I'm not entirely sure, but for favorites, I think I work best with INFJs and INFPs. I have gotten along with with ESFJs. I tend to be indifferent towards the others, but I have had some conflicts with ISTJs and an ENFJ. I wouldn't want to generalize these though.If you've taken any other personality tests, included but not limited to tests like the Enneargram and Big 5 (SLOAN), what were your results?Enneagram - 4w5 Occupation ~* Employed or Unemployed? I'm a studentWhat is your education? In college, tell us your major. Engineering and STSWhat is your dream job? Professor, preferably in the humanities About You ~* Tell us in a brief paragraph or two how you would describe yourself and what you hope to get out of this forum.I've lurked around on these forums for a while and thought that I should just join. Though generally rather reserved, I try to make myself stand out in subtle ways, such as my appearance, my motivations, and my disposition towards trying new things. Because academia is rather competitive to enter, I attempt to use every tool that I discover to push my limitations; I tend to devalue innate ability. I love exploring the human condition and how we build knowledge around it.Yet, at the same time, differentiating myself can become quite alienating and makes it difficult for me to learn about other people, which tends to be a large source of my emotional energy. I joined PerC in hopes of meeting new people and potentially forming some friendships. Whether or not a person agrees with me on issues doesn't matter to me, I tend to care more about their temperament and outlook on life. Uniqueness generally piques my interest. In general, I am a rather serious person, which can sometimes grind against most of my college peers. I generally have to wear masks to efficiently communicate, and my hope would be to not have to do so here.Other ~What is your favourite section at the toy-store? I don't recall the last time that I visited a toy store.Do you collect anything? Scarves, in particular those made of cotton and viscose, rayon is okay too. Being a male and wearing scarves as part of my fashion makes me more memorable.What are your phobias? Acrophobia, arachnophobia, entomophobia.Describe your favourite food until you drool. Food tastes rather bland in general to me, but I like tofu, curry, and pho (and similar noodle soup dishes)Some of the things that you give you jollies? Talking to people about their futures and motivations or about humanity.What are your top five pet peeves? 1. Using popularity as a justification.2. Not necessarily a pet peeve, but I feel anguish whenever someone emphasizes a lack of innate ability or opportunity as a primary reason for not trying something.3. When people tell me to cut my hair! It's currently shoulder length, and I'm growing it out at the moment.4. Smugness and humble bragging generally rub me the wrong way.5. Whenever people cite money as their primary motivation for their pursuits.Extra! When people make assumptions regarding my (or others'!) gender or sexuality based on appearance. I generally frown upon labels of feminine being characteristic of women or masculine as being characteristic of men.What would a perfect day be like for you? Meeting and spending a day talking with a new friend (a lifelong friend, preferably).Do you prefer a vegetarian or meat diet or both? I'm not vegetarian, but I don't eat too much meat.Other Other ~ Yay or Nay?God and Souls Yay, with some nuances.The Death Penalty Yay, with reservations.Premarital Sex Indifferent.People are inherently good Yay.Destiny Nay.Done drugs Nay.Kissed in the rain Nay, and probably would move towards shelter first.Re-reading a good book Yay.

Chesire Tower,,"Sit by my side, come as close as the air, Share in a memory of gray; Wander in my words, dream about the pictures That I play of changes. Green leaves of summer turn red in the fall To brown and to yellow they fade. And then they have to die, trapped within the circle time parade of changes. Scenes of my young years were warm in my mind, Visions of shadows that shine. Til one day I returned and found they were the Victims of the vines of changes. The world's spinning madly, it drifts in the dark Swings through a hollow of haze, A race around the stars, a journey through The universe ablaze with changes. Moments of magic will glow in the night All fears of the forest are gone But when the morning breaks they're swept away by golden drops of dawn, of changes. Passions will part to a strange melody. As fires will sometimes burn cold. Like petals in the wind, we're puppets to the silver strings of souls, of changes. Your tears will be trembling, now we're somewhere else, One last cup of wine we will pour And I'll kiss you one more time, and leave you on the rolling river shores of changes. So sit by my side, come as close as the air Share in a memory of gray Wander in my words, dream about the pictures That I play of changes""Changes""Artist: Phil OchsAlbum: MiscellaneousGenre: Folkphilosophy, psychology, creative writing, chess, dancing, web design, alternative music",,ThisPage,,Type 5w4,,[]

I feel like a lot of people I see in everyday society are pretending in how they interact and aren't free from cultural or free thinkers. So I am a loner in every sense of the word and I think I am too happy to be alone. I am sure there are some downsides and long term effects but right now, I'm pretty happy but aware enough to know I could be happier.I work at home, go to school at home. I am looking though to make an attempt to find a good person to hang out with I guess. Just to see if there is anybody truly like me out there. I thought I was an INFJ but I may be an INTP or blend of the two. It's been weird. The more I think on things the more I change to adapt to my new ""findings"". I do know that the old me and maybe the current me is concerned with the well being of others. But I find myself in a funk that requires selfish ambition to get out of so I can get back to helping others.I really love music. Right now my favorite band is Red Hot Chili Peppers and, just being honest here, I will totally thrash out in my room when listening to some of their songs, what are you gonna do, you know?Being a big movie buff, my favorite movie of 2017 is Thor Ragnorak, most hated movie is The Last Jedi, and my new favorite comedy of 2017/2018 is Community.I love my video games, but I've put them aside for a bit to read a lot so I can grow myself and my business.Bass, Computer Stuff, Video Games, Guitar, Movies and TV, Nerdful activities, Health&Fitness",,,,Unknown,,[]

I would snow bird, keep a membership to Planet Fitness, and may register in South Dakota with a  re-mail service and a Starlink Cell.In my work I can contract with many agencies to have a constant stream of work Thus I can avoid BS Company Jobs, people  & politicians who waste my time in their ""revolving doors"" and be free of that to be unencumbered.This may not be everyone's dream but being single makes it much more possible for me.There are those distractors who would accuse me of being a mysoginist for advocating that the men's human rights movement has as much right to exist as the feminist movement.  That a guy's right to remain single leads to claims that I'm a red pill wing nut and say all matters of evil against me, ( based on the very few post I've made here)  but that's them and their biasness or inability to cope with the world as it is while demanding inane changes to it.

Elusive_Certainty,[],"I've decided it's time I unofficially retire myself from Personality Cafe. At this point, I don't have to worry about outing myself: I've had several accounts on Personality Cafe over the course of several years, so I've technically been a member since somewhere between 2012 and 2013, give or take up to 6 months. I had my share of good and bad memories. One of the better memories being when I made my first and only friend on here over 2 years ago, and the worst memory being when the only friend I ever made on here seemingly killed herself a little over a year ago. I'm going to try to break the cycle that keeps drawing me here every year or so. Hopefully, I can do that by moving on to better online forums with less constricting rules and more intellectually diverse and open-minded communities. It goes without saying that the rise of the politically correct culture that I noticed increasing on Personality Cafe has influenced my decision to leave (hopefully for good). Lastly, I'll leave an email address in this bio in case any wayward traveler on Personality Cafe wishes to contact me one day: artificial_grit@protonmail.comThat email address shouldn't be going anywhere as long as Switzerland doesn't get nuked by some insane dictator, so rest assured, it will probably be active for years to come. It is basically a spam/stranger discussion email address, however, so I will probably only check it once every 1-8 weeks or so.

Igor,,"Self discovery is a hell of a drug, one that causes me to over analyze things too often to admit. For a long time I was convinced I was an INFP because of several poorly written profiles that convinced me that my misery was not my own fault. Which in retrospect was horrible both for myself as well as anyone else who identified as an INFP because of it. Let alone actual INFPs who had to live with such awful characterizations!Anyway, I'm rambling. My apologies. If you're actually reading this, you have my compliments. I'm simply a man who wants everyone in my life to be okay. I'm willing to work hard to see that it happens, but the truth I learned a long time ago is that the only person who can save you is yourself. It doesn't stop me from trying, however. I'm also an animal lover. I've been around livestock (particularly cattle) all of my life. No, I don't eat beef. I've seen too many animals I cared for deeply pass in unpleasant ways (despite my best efforts; such is the brutal truth of farm life, I'm afraid) and have no desire to eat beef as a result. I do, however, really really really love cheese. A lot. Honestly, want to get me started rambling again? Ask me something cheese-esque.Where was I?Oh, anyway, I was featured in an NPR piece on Millenials last year. Even got to close out the radio segment with a quote I gave. It made me feel rather special, though horribly embarrassed by how much I heard my voice quiver. What can I say? I'm a raging perfectionist, especially when it's myself involved.I occasionally blog, though not as often as I like. I also tweet quite regularly. Facebook concerns me, what with the violation of basic privacies and all that. Someday I plan on ruling the world just long enough to take brutal and efficient revenge on everyone and everything that hurt those that I care about, or those who hurt or abuse the poor or weak. It'll be an amazing few months, but I promise you won't be disappointed.Peace and love, y'all.Reading, Writing, Games, Gardening, ATVing, Theater",Western Utah,ThisPage,Female,,Male,[]

They like colorful events, multi-colored images and colorful people. They are diverse and accepting and generally love people.These two Tritypes are very similar at first glance. However, the difference between the 3 and the 2 is important. The 279 is the most relational Tritype and the 379 is the most positive Tritype. 379s are even more positive that the 279s. They care about people like the 279 but focus more on their achievements. Both Tritypes avoid conflict and want to be upbeat...but how?The 279 needs easy relating and positive encounters...they try to smooth things over so people are happy and easier to be around. ) They focus on okness.The 379 needs to ""be"" an exemplar of what is positive. They are like a handful of colorful balloons. They also love images of rainbows and balloons regardless of what type leads. The 3 needs to be positive to be a success in the eyes of others...their can-do nature is motivated by what is positive to be liked. The 7 needs to be upbeat and is motivated by what is possible to be liked.The 9 needs to be comfortable and feels they must be kind and harmonious to be liked.So the 379 struggles when they have a disappointing experience and don't achieve their goal. They are quick to deny painful emotions in favor of pseudo happiness and turn lemons into lemonade more than any other Tritype.When they are down their world become bleak and gray. It is an opportunity for introspection and growth but for this Tritype it needs to be in small bites.So when a painful experience is chronic and needs time to heal the 379 can become impatient and very hard on themselves for being down. Like the balloons of happiness that become deflated,when in pain, the 379 can come across as shallow due to their effort to be positive when they are actually feeling despair and a sense of inner emptiness. They can feel like empty calories.They love people and the energy that comes from being connected to people. They like color in every form. Like flowers that turn to face the sun, 379s need the inspiration that comes from the positive feedback they receive for being good-natured. They are secretly very ambitious but seek affirmation in a quiet way.The 379 Tritype needs to be positive. They lose their motivation to be and become.They want success and to feel upbeat but also seek quiet stardom.Everything.",,,,,Female,[]

Magic Qwan,,"I am a male who was born in 1996. I was born and raised in Louisiana, but I've always dreamed of moving to Alaska or Hawaii. Either will offer a great adventure. I would also love to travel the world as travel nurse.I was raised in a cult known as the Jehovah's Witnesses, but after I saw flaws in their teachings, the Watchtower Society lost its hold over me. Now, I am free to celebrate the richness of life without fear of a psychotic despot in the sky who would kill me for not belonging to some obscure group. I am currently interested in learning about Unitarian Universalism, but Agnostic Atheist would best describe my views about dieties and the supernatural. I am also a Secular Humanist, as I believe in aiding my fellow humans to lead rich, healthy lives.After working as a snowcone salesman, I learned I love pleasing others. I am studying to become a nurse and I am in the process of becoming licensed as a pharmacy tech.--Here's an update after 8 more years of aging and growing in the world. I'm still living in Louisiana, and the nursing and pharmacy tech careers weren't for me. I've grown surly and more introverted, and I now work as a high school special education teacher. I look at the world with more jaundiced eyes and prefer the safety and security of my current work to any kind of chaos. I learned with age that ""adventuring"" usually doesn't turn out so well. I'm still a secular humanist, and I still do some activism with the Unitarian Universalists, but as it stands right now, I'm just planning on continuing to teach until I can retire, and then using my pension to travel the world.MBTI, swimming, fiction writing, painting, drawing, trying new foods, daydreaming",,ThisPage,,,Male,[]

Nice to meet you.We INTJ gals are a rarity so I'm going on a hunt on the internet to try to find some likeminded girl friends.I always knew I was different and didn't really fit in with the other girls and decided to do some research on it. Turns out it's because I'm INTJ. Doesn't really feel as awesome as the personality tests describe. Feels more lonely than anything which stinks because I'm a super happy, active, good vibes kind of chick.So, if we're going to make friends let's get the small talk out of the way, lol I'm a photographer, web designer and social media strategist full time for a skincare line located just north of Los Angeles.Other than my creative businesses I'm also an ecommerce business owner. My husband of 4 years and I recently sold our business called Southern California Medical College to start a new venture in eCommerce. We will be launching and 6 to 8 weeks!! Yay, cant wait!!I enjoy the creative + business scene but more so only the creatives who are slaying at what they're doing. My 4 creative muses are Katrina Scott, Karena, Jasmine Star and Promise Tangeman ... love em to death.Outside of work stuff I'm pretty active and social in smaller groups of people. Doesn't matter where we are (work, with family or friends, church) I ALWAYYYS value a good sarcastic banter sesh with inside jokes! And memes? Heck yes!I enjoy going out to dinner with smaller groups of friends to places that arent super fancy or loud like BJs.Love going to the movies and Netflix (Travelers, Vampire Diaries, Reign, Merlin, 13 Reasons Why, A-Typiacal anyone?!).Love health and fitness, working out and oober (super bomb.com + delish) healthy recipes. Hanging with a girlfriend after a yoga class, making a healthy dinner and rose sounds fun. I'm a member of Tone It Up with Karena and Katrina for the last 5 years. (Keep it light, keep it tight! Lol)I live in the mountains so hiking and campingis super fun.So yea, if you're a chick with an INTJ personality looking to make other INTJ chick friends hit me up! Would absolutely love to meet you!  Love,ToniWorking Out, Healthy Food, Growing My Businesses, Meeting People (in small amounts)",,ThisPage,,Unknown,Female,[]

Tsubaki,[],"I was born on a warm summer afternoon not too long ago. Everyone immediately noticed that there was something special about me, but they had no idea about what was to come. When I was 11 years old, I was at a farm with my parents and I wanted to try riding on a goat. However, as soon as I tried mounting the animal, it screeched and bit me in the arm. I went home with a minor injury, but late at night, my arm started burning and I felt something fuzzy spreading around the wound. Within the span of a few minutes, I grew fur all over my body, hooves and magnificent horns. Goat-Man was born! Since that night, I turn into Goat-man during every full moon and roam the streets, looking for prey to eat alive.","Outside, enjoying the so called ""real life""                                                                                                                                                                                Private",ThisPage,,Type 3w4,,[]
