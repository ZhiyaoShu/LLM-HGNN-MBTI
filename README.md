## Overview

This project presents a novel framework combining hypergraphs with large language models (LLMs) to analyze personality traits from online social networks, aiming to overcome the limitations of traditional data mining methods, and leveraging the associative capabilities of LLMs and the structural potential of hypergraphs to provide a more profound analysis of user behavior and interactions within dynamic flows, networks in digital realms.

### Key Contributions

This project makes three significant contributions to the field:

1. **Prompt-based Personality Extraction**: We have designed a novel prompt-based method to effectively extract users' personality traits from large language models.
2. **Data Collection and Analysis**: We performed extensive data collection and analysis from the Personality Cafe forum, enabling comprehensive insights into user profiles and interactions.
3. **Hypergraph-based Modeling**: We proposed a new model using Deep hypergraphs to capture the intricate relationships among users and their personality traits. This model can be used to depict social environments and energy flows in real-world scenarios.

## [Datasets](data/users_data_all.json)

We collected totally **85462** users profiles from **[Personality Cafe](https://www.personalitycafe.com/)**, with the following information:

- Usernames
- MBTI types
- Gender
- Followers
- Self-descriptions (About section)
- Sexual orientation
- Enneagram Type

We selected **17035** users with complete MBTI and Enneagram information for our experiments. For reviewing concern, we will open our dataset once accepted.
